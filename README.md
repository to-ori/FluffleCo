# FluffleCo
Android application, created in Android Studio.
Developed for the NUIG Software Design and Development industry project.

This project aims to develop a fully functioning application for pet owners. 
The application should allow users to search for products, view product details and reviews. 
Additionally there should be a community forum that allows users to post new and reply to pre-existing questions. 
This will allow users with different experiences to come together to help one another and exchange knowledge. 

System Overview
The application will join with a database containing user details, product detail and all posts and reviews submitted to the application.
Users will need to have internet access as, in order to allow for products and related information to be updated a non-local database 
will need to be used. 
As users will have the ability to review and post within the app, for traceability, they will need to register/login to gain access.

Linked through php pages to a MySQL database. NUIG has temporarily given the developer space on the danu server.
